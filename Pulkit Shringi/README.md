# Alexa Weather Station (Weather-App) ⛈️
- I have created a weather-app using OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) for Alexa Developers SRM Recruitment round which allows users to check the weather for a specific location.
- Web Link -> https://pulkitshringi02.github.io/weather-app/
###  My weather App is filled with lot of features such as :-
- The project has a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.
- Users can input a city name in the search bar to get weather information for that specific location.
### Use Current Location:
- There's an option to use the user's current location to fetch weather data based on their GPS coordinates.
### Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) :
- Users can switch between Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F) temperature units.
### Font Awesome Icons:
- It uses Font Awesome icons for various UI elements.
### Background Images:
- The background image changes dynamically based on the current weather conditions, enhancing the user experience.
#### 5-Day Weather Forecast:
- The project provides a 5-day weather forecast for the selected city, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a weather icon for each day.
### Responsive Design:
- The application is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, thanks to media queries.
### Loading Indicator:
- Loading spinners are displayed while data is being fetched from the API to provide feedback to the user.
### Error Handling:
- There are error handling mechanisms in place to handle cases where the city name is not valid or there are issues with fetching data from the API.
