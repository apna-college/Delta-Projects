# Wall Streets Bets API {reddit}

My project contains two bottoms on the top right corner
"top" and "hot"

when any one of them is clicked My project uses the reddit API
and fetches the "top" posts for the day or the most recent "hot"
posts that were submitted on their subreddit.

All the posts are then loaded on the page. in their own "div" box.
when the post has no image - then the user can click on the link
given below to go to post's source.
